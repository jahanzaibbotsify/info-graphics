## 🔧 Implementation Details

### 1. **Primary Validation in `generateInfographic`**

Location: `backend/openAiClient.js` (Step 0)

```javascript
// Validates user requests before any processing
const validationPrompt = `You are a content validator for a data visualization AI system...`;
```

**Process:**
1. Analyzes user request against acceptable/unacceptable criteria
2. Uses GPT-4 with low temperature (0.1) for consistent validation
3. Returns "VALID" or "INVALID" 
4. Throws descriptive error if invalid

### 2. **Chat Message Validation in `analyzeMessageForModification`**

Location: `backend/openAiClient.js`

```javascript
// Validates messages in chat context for infographic modifications
async function analyzeMessageForModification(message, chatContext)
```

**Process:**
1. First validates if message is appropriate for data visualization
2. If valid, analyzes intent: "modify" or "factual"
3. Returns appropriate classification for downstream processing

### 3. **Factual Response Generation in `generateConversationalResponse`**

Location: `backend/openAiClient.js`

```javascript
// Generates educational responses about infographic data
async function generateConversationalResponse(message, chatContext, existingInfographic)
```

**Features:**
- Focuses on factual data and statistical insights
- Provides educational explanations about data visualization
- Offers constructive suggestions for data interpretation
- Stays within data visualization context

## 📱 Frontend Integration

### Error Handling in `Create.vue`

**Invalid Request Response:**
```javascript
if (error.response?.status === 400 && error.response?.data?.type === 'invalid_request') {
  lastMessage.content = `❌ ${error.response.data.error}`
  // Shows comprehensive suggestions with examples
}
```

**Enhanced Suggestions:**
- Categorized examples (Business, Technology, Health, Environmental)
- Specific data points included ("Q4 revenue dashboard with $2.5M total sales")
- Clear formatting with emojis for better UX

### Updated Initial Suggestions

The welcome screen now shows data-focused examples:
- "Q4 business metrics with $2.8M revenue and 15% growth"
- "Social media engagement: Instagram vs TikTok analytics"
- "Diabetes awareness: statistics and prevention tips"
- etc.

## 🧪 Validation Examples

### ✅ **Valid Requests**
```
✓ "Create a Q4 revenue dashboard showing $2.4M in sales"
✓ "Social media engagement analytics for Instagram vs TikTok"
✓ "Diabetes prevention statistics and health tips"
✓ "Climate change temperature data by region"
✓ "Remote work productivity metrics for 2024"
✓ "Customer satisfaction survey with 89% positive rating"
```

### ❌ **Invalid Requests**
```
✗ "How to make chocolate chip cookies"
✗ "Best movies of 2024"
✗ "Plan a vacation to Paris"
✗ "Fashion trends for winter"
✗ "Write a funny story about cats"
✗ "Car maintenance tips"
```

## 🚨 Error Messages

### Primary Error Message
```
"I specialize in creating factual data visualizations and infographics. 
Please provide requests related to statistics, data analysis, business metrics, 
health data, technology trends, or other factual information that can be 
visualized. Generic requests like recipes, entertainment, or unrelated 
topics are outside my expertise."
```

### Chat Context Error
```
"I can only help with factual data and infographic modifications. 
Please ask questions about your infographic data or request specific 
changes to your visualization."
```

## 🔄 System Flow

1. **User submits request** → Frontend (`Create.vue`)
2. **Request sent to backend** → Controller (`InfographicController.chatGenerateInfographic`)
3. **AI validation check** → OpenAI Client (`generateInfographic` Step 0)
4. **If invalid** → Error thrown with specific message
5. **If valid** → Continue to template selection and generation
6. **Frontend handles error** → Shows helpful suggestions and examples
